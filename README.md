## Took this over, so yeet 

# noNotch
Hide the notch with a nice black border on iPhone X.

Made @Jakeashacks. Minor contributions by @LaughingQuoll. A lot of credits go to http://iphonedevwiki.net for their awesome documentation on iOS's internal methods. The tweak is heavily commented and I hope beginner devs learn something from this :) (If you do, check out my other projects!)

Feel free to ask any questions on Twitter and to report bugs using the "Issues" tab.

# Changelog
- ALL fullscreen apps are fixed now, not just landscape ones

# TODO
- Settings pane
- Select which apps to enable this on via Settings
- Fix bugs real iPhone X users have?

# HOW TO INSTALL
1. Get it off BigBoss or jakeashacks.com/cydia

# Wanna compile this yourself?
No worries! Theos Installer is available on jakeashacks.com/cydia and supports iOS 11. You can use that to install theos with one click! To compile just download this somewhere, 'cd' into it and run 'make clean package'
